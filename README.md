# Vehicle Builder Demo

## Description
The purpose of building this application was to experiment with classes and separating out concerns into various files. Perhaps the most common ways to do that is with vehicles. A Car is a type of vehicle as is a motorbike as is a truck. But, they all offer different things that they can do, as you'll soon see in trying out the application. I think it's an extremely useful way of demonstrating how OOP (Object Oriented Programming) works.

This is meant to be more of a learning project than solving a problem,  though it does demonstrate how to separate out the interface from the objects effectively. 

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
Simply download the application and run with ```npm start```. This will start the application and give you a chance to build your own cars, trucks, and motorcycles. (Because, let's face it, who doesn't want a mini car builder?!)

## Usage

Video demonstration of the application can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141BzHhC2LAO2EFBiyQ60TvW3yOKlPNEw/view?usp=sharing)

Download the application and begin contructing vehicles. Can all vehicles do wheelies? Can all the vehicles tow? What happens if the vehicle is too heavy for another to tow? These are questions that can be answered as part of this application.
